This is a text game. Game.cpp contains the code of the game with game.h holding the declarations. Contains a makefile for the game as well.
The file Saved.data is where the game state will be saved, it is not encrypted, and is in plain text, so if at some point you save the game
don't go into the file or else you will be spoiled in terms of where your character is.
Commands for movement in game are Up to go up/North, Right to go right/East, Left to go left/West, Down to go down/South.
Other game commands are Save (to save the game to Saved.data), Quit (to quit the game), and Print (prints the game board without showing
where you are as the player so as to not spoil the game for you.
